## Inside 30DaysOfPython create a folder called day_2. Inside this folder create a file named variables.py
### Just going to use this script so I can use a different naming convention

## Write a python comment saying 'Day 2: 30 Days of python programming'
### 'Day 2: 30 Days of python programming'

## Declare a first name variable and assign a value to it
first_name = "Nick"

## Declare a last name variable and assign a value to it
last_name = "Lyon"

## Declare a full name variable and assign a value to it
full_name = "Nick Lyon"

## Declare a country variable and assign a value to it
country = "USA"

## Declare a city variable and assign a value to it
city = "SB"

## Declare an age variable and assign a value to it
age = 73.3

## Declare a year variable and assign a value to it
year = 2024

## Declare a variable is_married and assign a value to it
is_married = False

## Declare a variable is_true and assign a value to it
is_true = True

## Declare a variable is_light_on and assign a value to it
light_on = False

## Declare multiple variables on one line
var_first, var_second = "hello", "world"

# Exercises: Level 2

## Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
print(type(first_name))
print(type(last_name))
print(type(full_name))
print(type(country))
print(type(city))
print(type(age))
print(type(year))
print(type(is_married))
print(type(is_true))
print(type(light_on))
print(type(var_first))
print(type(var_second))

## Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
print(len(first_name))

## Compare the length of your first name and your last name
print(len(first_name) - len(last_name))

## Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
num_one, num_two = 5, 4

## Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
variable_total = num_one + num_two

## Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
variable_diff = num_two - num_one

## Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
variable_product = num_one * num_two

## Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
variable_div = num_one / num_two

## Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
variable_remain = num_one % num_two

## Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
variable_exp = num_one ** num_two

## Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
variable_floor_div = num_one // num_two

## The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
radius = 30

## Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
area_of_circle = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)

## Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
circum_of_circle = 2 * 3.14 * radius

## Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
# user_radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a hypothetical circle:"))
# user_area = 3.14 * (user_radius ** 2)
# print("The area of that circle is", user_area)

## Use the built-in input function to get first name, last name, country and age from a user and store the value to their corresponding variable names
# user_first, user_last, user_country, user_age = input("Type your first name:"), input("Type your last name:"), input("Type your country:"), input("Type your age:")
# print(user_first, user_last, "is", user_age, "years old and lives in", user_country)

## Run help('keywords') in Python shell or in your file to check for the Python reserved words or keywords
# print(help("keywords"))
