# '30 Days of Python' Challenge

This repository stores my attempts at the '[30 Days of Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/tree/master)' challenge. Incidentally, this is also the start of my exploration of VS Code's integration with Git/GitHub

Scripts (notes and exercises) start with a zero-padded number for the day with which they correspond. Further explanation can be found inside of each script.
