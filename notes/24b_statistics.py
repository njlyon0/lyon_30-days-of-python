Statistics

"Statistics" is a very broad term that encapsulates a lot of territory but generally contains many tools built to summarize or compare data. These tools are prerequisite to both data science generally and machine learning approaches more specifically.

Python includes a "statistics" module for doing simple mathematical statistics on numeric data. It can be valuable but is not meant to compete with either more nuanced Python packages (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, etc.) or standalone non-Python statistical languages (e.g., R, SAS, Matlab, etc.).

These notes are mostly focused on the "numpy" module but delve into the "statistics" module as needed.
