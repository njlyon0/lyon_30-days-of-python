"""
Variables are how Python stores data in computer memory
These variables can be invoked / operated on as aliases for the data they contain

Note that variable names are case-sensitive and can only contain letters/numbers or underscores
Snake case (e.g., "my_variable") is a common convention for Python programmers
"""

# Variables can be assigned in a process called "variable declaration" with an equal sign
test_var = [1, 2, 3]
print(test_var)

# You can declare multiple variables in the same line if desired
test_var1, test_var2, test_var3 = "hello", "world", "!"
print([test_var1, test_var2, test_var3])

# Variables can be defined interactively in the Terminal with the 'input' function
# first_name = input("Type your name:")
# print(first_name)
